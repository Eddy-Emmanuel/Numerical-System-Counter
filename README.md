# Numerical System Counter

## Overview

The Numerical System Counter is a simple Python program designed to display decimal, hexadecimal, and binary representations of numbers within a specified range. The program allows users to input a starting number and the number of iterations, providing a quick reference for numerical representations in different systems.

## Features

1. **Decimal, Hexadecimal, Binary Display**: Displays numbers in decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats.

2. **User Interaction**: Accepts user input for the starting number and the number of iterations.

3. **Exit Option**: Users can exit the program by entering "exit" at the starting number prompt.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/numerical-system-counter.git
   cd numerical-system-counter
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**

   ```bash
   python numerical_system_counter.py
   ```

3. **Follow On-screen Prompts:**

   - Enter the starting number.
   - Enter the number of iterations to display.
   - Type "exit" to end the program.

## Example

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example runs the program, allowing users to input a starting number and the number of iterations to display the corresponding decimal, hexadecimal, and binary representations.
